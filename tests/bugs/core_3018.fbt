  """
    NOTE: FB 4.x has incompatible behaviour with all previous versions since build 4.0.0.2131 (06-aug-2020):
    statement 'alter sequence <seq_name> restart with 0' changes rdb$generators.rdb$initial_value to -1 thus
    next call of gen_id(<seq_name>,1) will return 0 (ZERO!) rather than 1. 
    See also CORE-6084 and its fix: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/23dc0c6297825b2e9006f4d5a2c488702091033d
    This is considered as *expected* and is noted in doc/README.incompatibilities.3to4.txt

    For this reason, old code was removed and now test checks only ability to use statements rather than results of them.
    Checked on: 4.0.0.2119; 4.0.0.2164; 3.0.7.33356.
