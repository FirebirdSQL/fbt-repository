 """
   Instead of usage 'resource:test_user' (as it was before) we create every time this test run  user TMP$C1148
   and make test connect to database as this user in order to check ability to connect and get engine version.
   Then we parse engine version (is it 2.5 or 3.0 ?) and construct command to obtain Firebird log using FBSVCMGR
   (switches differ for 2.5 and 3.0! For 2.5 it must be: "action_get_ib_log", for 3.0: "action_get_fb_log").
   After that we try to extract firebird log using fbsvcmgr and this command is EXPECTED return error, so we log
   this message to separate file (and STDOUT is redirected to /dev/null).
   Finally, we check content of 1st and 2nd files and remove temply created user.
