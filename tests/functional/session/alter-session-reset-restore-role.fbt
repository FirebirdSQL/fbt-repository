   Test issue from CORE-5832 about ALTER SESSION RESET:
   "restore ROLE which was passed with DPB and clear all cached security classes (if role was changed) ".

   NOTE. *** SET AUTODDL OFF REQUIRED ***
       Following is detailed explanation of this note:
       ========
           Default ISQL behaviour is to start always *TWO* transactions (for DML and second for DDL)
           after previous commit / rollback and before *ANY* further satement is to be executed, except
           those which control ISQL itself (e.g. 'SET TERM'; 'IN ...'; 'SET BAIL' etc).
           So, even when statement <S> has nothing to change, ISQL will start TWO transactions
           just before executing <S>.
           This means that these transactions will start even if want to run 'ALTER SESSION RESET'.
           This, in turn, makes one of them (which must perform DDL) be 'active and NOT current'
           from ALTER SESSION point of view (which is run within DML transaction).

           According to description given in CORE-5832, ALTER SESSION throws error isc_ses_reset_err
           "if any open transaction exist in current conneciton, *except of current transaction* and
           prepared 2PC transactions which is allowed and ignored by this check".

           So, we have to prohibit 'autostart' of DDL-transaction because otherwise ALTER SESSION will
           throw: "SQLSTATE = 01002 / Cannot reset user session / -There are open transactions (2 active)".
           This is done by 'SET AUTODDL OFF' statement at the beginning of this test script.
       ========

   Thanks to Vlad for explanations (discussed 18.01.2021).
