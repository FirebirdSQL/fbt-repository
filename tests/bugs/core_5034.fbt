 """
   This test uses Python multiprocessing package in order to spawn multiple processes with trivial job: attach/detach from DB.
   Number processes ('planned_attachments') and of iterations for each of them ('reconnect_count') depends on FB architecture 
   which is obtained by call of SP sys_get_fb_arch.
   For ClassicServer weird effect was detected: when number of processes is more then ~34-35 some of Python processes may not
   finish (but CS processes are gone and thus database has no attachments).
   Database is created with DB_level trigger 'on disconnect' which issues post_event and writes 'now'-timestamp to the table.
   Because we have dozen of different running processes, one need to distinguish records in the table for every of attachments.
   But values of current_connection are not suitable: they are unknown outside of DB connection, i.e. at the moment when we
   just return from DB attachment we still need to know some number that was 'linked' to just finished connection process.
   For this purpose ROLES are used in this test: we generate them beforehand (ee 'init_test' section) and when create new
   attachment then specify ROLE in its arguments: 'R_000' for 1st spawned python process, 'R_001' for 2nd etc.
   Value of current_role will be written by DB-trigger in the table LOG4DETACH.
   When attachment finishes and control is returned to Python child process, we catch current timestamp again and save it
   value inside Python data structure 'sqllst' - common list.
   After some process will finish iterations, it will build SQL script for further applying to database and save it to the file
   with name that reflects to this process: 'tmp_5034_after_detach_NNN.log' whene NNN = '000', '001' etc.
   This file will contain INSERT command with values of timestamp that were on every iteration just after disconnect.
   After all processes will finish, we'll have completed set of such files and they will be "concatenated" together for applying
   at once by single call of ISQL.
   Finally, we can analyze values of datediff() between moments of 'just before' and 'just after' disconnects.
   In order to properly detect records that correspond to post-apply scripts (with INSERT statements) special integer field 'SEQ'
   is used: it will have even values for event when we are 'just before detach' (i.e. "inside" database connection) and odd values
   when we are 'just after' (i.e. when connection has been just closed). The view 'v_top10_slow' is used to display connects which
   were closed too slow. 
   Normally, this view should return ONE record with text 'Detaches were fast'. 
   Otherwise it will return concrete values of time that was spent on detach process, in milliseconds.

   Following parameters: 'planned_attachments' and 'reconnect_count' affects on test result **VERY** strong, especially on Classic.
   You may need to change them if test results are unstable. Do NOT make value of 'planned_attachments' more than 33-34 on Classic!
