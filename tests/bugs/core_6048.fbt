    Test database that is created by fbtest framework will be encrypted here using IBSurgeon Demo Encryption package
    ( https://ib-aid.com/download-demo-firebird-encryption-plugin/ ; https://ib-aid.com/download/crypt/CryptTest.zip )
    License file plugins\dbcrypt.conf with unlimited expiration was provided by IBSurgeon to Firebird Foundation (FF).
    This file was preliminary stored in FF Test machine.
    Test assumes that this file and all neccessary libraries already were stored into FB_HOME and %FB_HOME%\plugins.

    Anyone who wants to run this test on his own machine must
    1) download https://ib-aid.com/download/crypt/CryptTest.zip AND 
    2) PURCHASE LICENSE and get from IBSurgeon file plugins\dbcrypt.conf with apropriate expiration date and other info.

    FF tests storage (aka "fbt-repo") does not (and will not) contain any license file for IBSurgeon Demo Encryption package!

    Checked on:
        4.0.0.1575: OK, 3.024s.

    === NOTE-1 ===
    In case of "Crypt plugin DBCRYPT failed to load/607/335544351" check that all 
    needed files from IBSurgeon Demo Encryption package exist in %FB_HOME% and %FB_HOME%\plugins
    %FB_HOME%:
        283136 fbcrypt.dll
       2905600 libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll
        481792 libssl-1_1-x64.dll

    %FB_HOME%\plugins:
        297984 dbcrypt.dll
        306176 keyholder.dll
           108 DbCrypt.conf
           856 keyholder.conf
    
    === NOTE-2 ===
    Version of DbCrypt.dll of october-2018 must be replaced because it has hard-coded 
    date of expiration rather than reading it from DbCrypt.conf !!

    === NOTE-3 ===
    firebird.conf must contain following line:
        KeyHolderPlugin = KeyHolder

#      but currently it is included only in FB 4.x builds (not in FB 3.x).
