'description':
  """
    Test uses TWO tables, one w/o indices and another with indexes.
    We evaluate RATIO between performance rather than absolute duration values.
    This ratio then is compared with THRESHOLD which was choosen after dozen runs
    of test on FB 3.0 and 4.0.

    _BEFORE_ this ticket was fixed ratio was following:
    
    Ratio for 4.0.0.258: ~32...34 -- poor
    Ratio for 3.0.1.32566: ~23...24 -- poor

    _AFTER_ ticket was fixed ratio is:

    Ratio for 4.0.0.313:   ~11...13 -- OK
    Ratio for 3.0.1.32568: ~10...11 -- OK

    Fix for 4.0 was 07-jul-2016, see here:
    https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/a75e0af175ea6e803101b5fd62ec91cdf039b951
    Fix for 3.0 was 27-jul-2016, see here:
    https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/96a24228b61003e72c68596faf3c4c4ed0b95ea1
