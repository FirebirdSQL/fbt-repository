 """
    ::: NB :::
    1. Currently test checks only ability to use SYNTAX for usage statements within PSQL blocks
       as it is described in '...\doc\sql.extensions\README.management_statements_psql.md'.
       Actual affects on further work are not verified.
    2. Deferred check of 'alter session reset': got SQLSTATE = 25000/no transaction for request.
       Sent letter to dimitr et al, 09-mar-2019 13:43.
    3. Deferred check of 'SET TRUSTED ROLE': it is unclear for me how to implement this. 
       Sent Q to Alex (same letter).

    All other cases are checked on 4.0.0.1421 and 4.0.0.1457: OK.

    10.12.2019. Updated syntax for SET BIND. Removed (maybe temply) check of 'set time zone bind native'.
    Checked on 4.0.0.1685.
