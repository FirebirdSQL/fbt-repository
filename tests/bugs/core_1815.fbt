 """
   ### NB ### This test was NOT completed! 
   One need to check all nuances related to granting and revoking that is issued by NON sysdba user
   which was granted admin option to manupulate appropriate DB objects.
   Also, there is not clarity about issue 08/Aug/16 06:31 AM (when user Boss2 does grant-and-revoke 
   sequence with some role to other user Sales but this role already was granted by _other_ user, Boss1).

   We create two users (acnt and pdsk) and two roles for them (racnt and rpdsk).
   Then we create two tables (tacnt & tpdsk) and grant access on these tables for acnt & pdsk.
   Then we create user boss, role for him (rboss) and grant IMPLICITLY access on tables tacnt and tpdsk 
   to user boss via his role (rboss).
   Check is made to ensure that user boss HAS ability to read from both tables (being connected with role Rboss).
   After all, we IMPLICITLY revoke access from these tables and check again that user boss now has NO access
   on tables tacnt and tpdsk.

   Checked on WI-T4.0.0.322 -- all fine.
