    This tests normal operation of database TRANSACTION START trigger when:
    1) more than one such triggers are defined
    2) NO exception raise within any trigger during its work, i.e. all of them shoudl finish Ok

    Triggers must work within the same Tx as "parent" statement (which launched this Tx).
