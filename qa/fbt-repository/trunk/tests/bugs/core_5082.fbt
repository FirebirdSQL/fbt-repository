  """
    Confirmed on build 32136 (RC1), build 32181: wrongly displayed names of non-existent user 'TMP$C5082'
    and user SYDSDBA that login was provided with wrong (but NOT empty) password.
    NOTE: check does NOT perform inside ES when password is empty string or any number of ascii_char(32) 
    and 'new' user specified is equal to user name that was used to login - see examples here when password
    for SYSDBA is '' or ascii_char(32).
