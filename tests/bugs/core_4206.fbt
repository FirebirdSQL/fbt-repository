  """
    ::: NB :::
    Behaviour of FB 4.x was changed since 06-aug-2020 when core-6084 was fixed:
    now FB 4.x will assign to ID column values which less than FB 3.x for 1.
    For this reason it was changed avoid check for concrete values.
    Rather, it is enough to verify only difference between max and min ID.

    Checked on 4.0.0.2164, 3.0.7.33356.
