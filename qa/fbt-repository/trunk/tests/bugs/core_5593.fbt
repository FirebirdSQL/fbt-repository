'description':
 """
   Test creates several roles and grants them to user.
   Role #1 is common ascii string without spaces.
   Role #2 is ascii string with spaces, all character are written in UPPERCASE.
   Role #3 is ascii string with spaces, all character are written in lowercase.

   After make connection to database using role #3 we have to check that this role
   indeed was applied to connection and that rdb$role_in_use *does* return this role name also.
   See also: github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/61b4bf0d276884a0ba0f2edef3b41fa2c58c87ee
   Comments there:
        - roleStr.upper();
        + //roleStr.upper();		// sorry - but this breaks role names containing lower case letters


   ::: NB CAUTION ::: TEMPLY DEFERRED :::
   We also have to check cases when role contains NON-ASCII characters but currently this is impossible.
   Exception like:
   ===
      Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 22001
      arithmetic exception, numeric overflow, or string truncation
      -string right truncation
      -expected length 63, actual 79
   ===
   - is raised when non-ascii role contains only ~40 *characters* and connection charset = UTF8.
