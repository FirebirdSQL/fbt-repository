 """
    Scenario for reproducing was given by Vlad, letter 25-02-2020 19:15.
    Unfortuinately, this crash can occur only in developer build rather than release one.

    Although issues from ticket can NOT be reproduced, it was encountered in 2.5.0.26074
    that statements from here lead DB to be corrupted:
        Error while commiting transaction:
        - SQLCODE: -902
        - database file appears corrupt...
        - wrong page type
        - page 0 is of wrong type (expected 6, found 1)
        -902
        335544335
   No such problem in 2.5.1 and above.
   Decided to add this .fbt just for check that DB will not be corrupted.

   TICKET ISSUE REMAINS IRREPRODUCIBLE (checked on following SuperServer builds: 2.5.1, 2.5.6, 2.5.9, 3.0.6, 4.0.0).
