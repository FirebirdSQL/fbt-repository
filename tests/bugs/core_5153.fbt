 """
   ::: NB :::
   Here we only check that server is alive after running query but WITHOUT checking its data
   (see: "and 1=0" below in HAVING section).
   We do NOT check correctness of query results - this will be done by another ticket, CORE-5165: 
   wrong result in 3.0 RC2 and 4.0 comparing 2.5. It's NOT related to this ticket.

   Confirmed success (no crash) on snapshots 3.0 RC2 and 4.0 with timestamp 23-mar-2016.
   Crash was detected on WI-V3.0.0.32378.
