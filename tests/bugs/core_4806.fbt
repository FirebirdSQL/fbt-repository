 """
    We create sequence ('g') and three users and one role.
    First user ('big_brother') is granted to use generator directly.
    Second user ('bill_junior') is gratned to use generator via ROLE ('stockmgr').
    Third user ('maverick') has no grants to use neither on role nor on generator.
    Then we try to change value of generator by call gen_id(g,1) by create apropriate
    connections (for each of these users).
    First and second users must have ability both to change generator and to see its
    values using command 'SHOW SEQUENCE'.
    Also, we do additional check for second user: try to connect WITHOUT specifying role
    and see/change sequence. Error must be in this case (SQLSTATE = 28000).
    Third user must NOT see neither value of generator nor to change it (SQLSTATE = 28000).

    :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: NB ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    18.08.2020. FB 4.x has incompatible behaviour with all previous versions since build 4.0.0.2131 (06-aug-2020):
    statement 'CREATE SEQUENCE <G>' will create generator with current value LESS FOR 1 then it was before.
    Thus, 'create sequence g;' followed by 'show sequence;' will output "current value: -1" (!!) rather than 0.
    See also CORE-6084 and its fix: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/23dc0c6297825b2e9006f4d5a2c488702091033d
    ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    This is considered as *expected* and is noted in doc/README.incompatibilities.3to4.txt

    Because of this, it was decided to filter out concrete values that are produced in 'SHOW SEQUENCE' command.

    Checked on:
        4.0.0.2164
        3.0.7.33356
