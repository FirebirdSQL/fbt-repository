 """
    Test uses pre-created database which has several procedures for analyzing performance by with the help of MON$ tables.
    Performance results are gathered in the table STAT_LOG, each odd run will save mon$ counters with "-" sign and next
    (even) run will save them with "+" -- see SP_GATHER_STAT.
    Aggegation of results is done in the view V_AGG_STAT (negative values relate to start, positive to the end of measure,
    difference between them means performance expenses which we want to evaluate).
    NOTE. Before each new measure we have to set generator G_GATHER_STAT to zero in order to make it produce proper values
    starting with 1 (odd --> NEGATIVE sign for counters). This is done in SP_TRUNCATE_STAT.

    :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: NB ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    18.08.2020. FB 4.x has incompatible behaviour with all previous versions since build 4.0.0.2131 (06-aug-2020):
    statement 'alter sequence <seq_name> restart with 0' changes rdb$generators.rdb$initial_value to -1 thus next call
    gen_id(<seq_name>,1) will return 0 (ZERO!) rather than 1. 
    See also CORE-6084 and its fix: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/23dc0c6297825b2e9006f4d5a2c488702091033d
    ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    This is considered as *expected* and is noted in doc/README.incompatibilities.3to4.txt

    Because of this, it was decided to change code of SP_TRUNCATE_STAT: instead of 'alter sequence restart...' we do
    reset like this: c = gen_id(g_gather_stat, -gen_id(g_gather_stat, 0));
